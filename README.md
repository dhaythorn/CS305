Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company. Artemis needed to create a RESTful web application.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Software is extremely vulnerable to hackers if it isn't set up with security in mind.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Generating certificates and learning about Eclipse, Maven, and the rest of the Java ecosystem was very helpufl to me.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Input validation, APIs, crytpography and general security for client/server applications.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Testing and certificate generation and different Maven/Java tools allowed me to do this.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Java, Maven, Spring, and all the details of working with those technologies.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I think this assignment in general is a good example of that.
